Using computer to calculate some problems. If you are boring with your computer, try to torture it with these programs.
  
## Perfect number
This is a little demo to calculate all the numbers from 2 to number range you specified.  
Perfect number: A positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding itself.  Such as 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.  
The first 5 perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128 and 33550336. By this demo it's easy to reach the first 4 ones, but to reach 33550336, it may cost at least one day.  

## Amicable numbers
This is a little demo to calculate all the amicable numbers pairs from 2 to number range you specified.  
Amicable numbers: Two different numbers related in such a way that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. Such as the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.  
The first 5 amicable number pairs are (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368). It's easy to find a lot of amicable number pairs.
